  <em>Connecting India's Hidden Sports Talent with Opportunities</em>

## üìñ Project Description
‚ú® **Problem Statement:**
 Talented athletes from Tier 2, Tier 3 cities and rural India lack structured visibility and access to coaches, selectors, and opportunities. Traditional talent discovery is limited to urban networks, leaving countless gifted athletes undiscovered. Selectors struggle to find genuine talent beyond their immediate circles, while fans have no organized platform to support emerging athletes early in their careers.

üí° **Proposed Solution:**
 Sports Hub is an digital platform that democratizes sports talent discovery by connecting athletes, selectors/coaches, and fans in one ecosystem. Athletes can create verified profiles, and apply to trials/events. Selectors can post events, discover talent through AI-powered matching, and manage applications efficiently. Fans can follow athletes, engage with their content, and offer micro-sponsorships to support their journey.
  
üéØ **Target Users / Use Cases:** 
- **Athletes (13-35 years):** Create digital portfolios, get AI coaching feedback, apply for trials, gain visibility
- **Selectors/Coaches:** Post events, discover talent with AI matching, manage applications, shortlist candidates
- **Fans:** Discover emerging talent, follow athletes, engage with content, provide micro-sponsorships

1. **Research & Ideation**  
   - Identified the talent discovery gap in Indian sports ecosystem
   - Analyzed athlete, selector, and fan pain points through surveys
   - Defined MVP features prioritized for hackathon timeline

2. **Design**  
   - Created comprehensive App Requirement Document (ARD)
   - Designed user flows for 3 distinct roles (Athlete, Selector, Fan)
   - Developed wireframes and UI mockups with blue-themed Indian sports aesthetic
   - Architected database schema optimized for Supabase PostgreSQL

   - **Phase 5:** AI Coach for video analysis and AI Talent Matcher for selectors
   - **Phase 6:** Fan dashboard with social features (follow, like, comment)
   - **Phase 7:** Selector dashboard, messaging, and admin panel
   - Used Lovable AI for rapid frontend development with React + TypeScript
   - Implemented backend with Supabase (BaaS) for authentication, database, and storage

4. **Test**  
   - Created test accounts for all user roles
   - End-to-end testing of user journeys (signup ‚Üí profile ‚Üí events ‚Üí applications)
   - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Responsive design testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Performance testing (loading times, file uploads)
